# MediSense AI

MediSense AI is an AI-powered healthcare assistant designed to provide real-time symptom analysis and personalized medical advice. It leverages OpenAI's advanced language models to help users get immediate healthcare insights, making medical advice accessible to all, especially in underserved areas.

## Project Overview
MediSense AI allows users to:

- Register and securely log in.
- Input their symptoms and receive personalized AI-driven medical advice.
- Store and view their previous symptom logs for later reference.
- Access a user-friendly interface to interact with the system efficiently.

## Features

### User Authentication:

- Users can securely register and log in to the system.
- User sessions are managed using Flask-Login.

### Symptom Checker:

- Users input symptoms and receive advice generated by OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
- Symptom logs and advice are stored in MongoDB.

### Symptom Log History:

- Users can view a history of their logged symptoms and received advice.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Python web framework for handling backend logic.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data and symptom logs.
- **OpenAI API**: Provides the AI-driven medical advice based on user input.
- **Flask-Login**: Manages user authentication and session control.
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the front-end interface.

flask run
```

Visit the application at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

## Usage

- **Register**: Navigate to `/register` to create a user account.
- **Login**: Navigate to `/login` to log in to your account.
- **Check Symptoms**: Use the symptom checker at `/check-symptoms` to receive AI-generated advice based on your symptoms.
- **View Symptom Logs**: View your history of symptoms and AI advice at `/view-logs`.

## Challenges & Improvements

- **Challenge**: Integrating MongoDB and managing user data securely posed challenges during development.
- **Improvements**: We plan to add more advanced features like user-specific health tips and a chatbot interface for quicker interaction.

## Next Steps

- Scaling the application with MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based data storage.
- Enhancing the front-end with modern UI frameworks such as React.
- Improving the AI model by training on more medical datasets.
